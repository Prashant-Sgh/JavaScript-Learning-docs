# What is JavaScript?
*JavaScript is a **Scripting** and a **Programming** language*
### What is a Scripting language?
*Scripting languages are typically interpreted rather than compiled, which means they are executed line by line at runtime. Primarily for automating tasks, web development, and enhancing existing applications.*
### What is a Programming language?
*Usually compiled into machine code before execution. Used for developing standalone applications, system software, and complex projects.*

**In short JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language - primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on websites.**

- *It allow us to implement complex(and simple) feature on our web pages.*
- *And with the help of JavaScript you can enable dynamic contents on your webpage....* like for example if you want to perform a certain action or a set of actions on the click of a button on your web page then you can do that with the help of JavaScript.

# Some things that JavaScript can do

- **To store a values -** you can store a value from your webpage in some variable.
- **Perform action -** it can perform certain actions when they are triggered by something (*on the click of a button -* one of the most common ways to trigger any actions).
- **APIs -** we can use APIs in our JavaScript program, it is like using *Doremon's gadgets to add extra functionality/features to Nobita* in your case it can add features and functionality to your website.


## Storing values in JavaScript
If you want to store a value in JavaScript you will need to assign a name to it **variable** this will act as a flag on the memory where you have stored the information.

### There are multiple ways to define a variable.
*These are some ways that tells the computer what type of variable you just defined
.*
**const** It will be a constant variable. You cannot redefine the variable again in the same program.
**let**   You can use this variable if you want the value of the variable to be flexible. You can redefine the varable inside another **scope**, whose value will be applicable only inside that particular scope. *(keep learning and you will know what **scope** means)*
**var**   It is similar to let but you cannot redefine it inside another **scope**.

### After you define the variable (where you can store a value) you can store different types of values.

- **STRING**
- **INT**
- **FLOAT**
- **BOOLEAN**
- **NULL**

- **OBJECT**
- **SYMBOL**

**string -** Normal texts like any name or sentences.
**int -**    Any integer values like 1....9999...
**float -**  Any decimal values like 3.14 or 1.695
**boolean -** At type of value which can be either true or false (if you see 1 and 0 it mesns true and false respectively).
**null -**   It means neither zero (0) nor "undefined", it means "nothing".
